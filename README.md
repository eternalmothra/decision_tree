Decision Tree

Should you undertake a research project for your company? On one hand, it will result in revenue and increased customer
satisfaction. But there are also costs associated with doing research. If you have a problem you'll run into even more costs.

What if you don't do the research project? Then you may incur costs like customer dissatisfaction, and lost revenue because you lose
sales.

This python script computes the utility (expected value) of your decision, and helps you make the right one. It also draws a 
decision tree.
